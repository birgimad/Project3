\chapter*{Abstract}
The project solves a multidimensional integral function involving quantum mechanical expectation value of the correlation energy between two electrons which repel each other via the classical Coulomb interaction using Guassian quadrature methods and Monte Carlo methods. 
In the Gaussian quadrature methods Legendre and Laguerre polynomials are used to solve the integral. 
It is observed that Laguerre polynomials gives better results compared to Legendre polynomials.
A brute force Monte Carlo and improved Monte Carlo method using importance sampling are employed to evaluate the integral.
The latter is found to be more more efficient in computing the integral in terms of computational speed and accuracy of the result among all the four methods that are used.
