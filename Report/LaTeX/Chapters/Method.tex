\chapter{Method}
\label{chap:method} 
In this chapter a short introduction of the nature of problem is given together with a brief analysis of the function whose integral is to be calculated is made. 
Furthermore, the Legendre and Laguerre method for computing the integral are presented. In these methods the Legendre and Laguerre polynomials are used to find the roots of the $n$'th polynomial and the corresponding weights of these roots. 
From the polynomial roots, the function is evaluated, and all of these function values are added up, taking the weights into account. 
The Monte Carlo method solves the integral using probability density functions (PDF) to evaluate the function in random numbers.
