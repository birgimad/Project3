%Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to label your results.
%All tables and figures should have relevant captions and labels on the axes.
The results gained by solving the integral presented in \matref{eq:NatureOfTheProblem2} using the four different methods presented in \chapref{chap:method} can be found in this chapter. 
The error of the computed integral value from the closed-form solution $5\pi ^2 / 16^2$ is furthermore calculated for the methods, and in \secref{sec:ComputationalTime} the computational time and accuracy of the four methods are compared.  

The results from running the codes for the Gauss-Legendre, Laguerre, brute force Monto Carlo and improved Monte Carlo method can be found in the GitHub folder  \url{https://github.com/birgimad/Project3/tree/master/Project3_BM_MI_SC}.
